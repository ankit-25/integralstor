- The main area will then display the list of all available pools along with the datasets/block device volumes in each of the pools.

- Corresponding to each pool, you will see a button saying “**View pool details**”. Clicking on this will take you to a screen that displays the pool details.

- You will then see a button that says “**Initiate a scrub**”. Clicking on this will initiate a scrub.
