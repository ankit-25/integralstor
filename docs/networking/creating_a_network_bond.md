# Creating a network bond

- Select the “**Networking**” main menu item on the left of the screen.

- Select the “**Network interfaces**” sub menu tab.

- At the end of the “**Network Bonds**” section, click on the “**Create a new bond**” button.

You will then be prompted for the following information needed to create a bond :

**Bond name** : A name for the bond being created.

**Bonding mode** : The UNICell system supports two modes of bonding – 802.3ad(mode 4) or balance-alb (mode 6). Please note that 802.3ad needs support and configuration on the switch side as well.

**Slave interfaces** : Select the interfaces that you want to include as part of this bond. Only those interfaces that are not already a part of another bond will be displayed here.
