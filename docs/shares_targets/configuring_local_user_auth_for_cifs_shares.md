# Configuring Local User authentication for CIFS shares

If Active Directory authentication is not the preferred option, UNICell also supports authentication based on local users and groups created on the UNICell system itself. These local users and groups can be created using IntegralView (refer to the section about local users and groups in this manual).

 To configure local user based authentication :

- Select the “**Services**” main menu item on the left of the screen.

- Select the “**Configure CIFS access**” sub menu tab.

- Make sure that the current authentication method is set to Local Users. If not, click on the “**Change authentication method**” button to select “**Local users**”. On selecting this, you will be taken to a screen which prompts for the workgroup in use in your network. Enter the workgroup and save.
