*Installing iso using CD/DVD method*

You can follow the traditional method to install this iso as we use any iso for installation of OS.

*Installing iso using USB method*

To convert this iso image into a bootable USB stick is as easy as running the command;

"livecd-iso-to-disk --resetmbr --format /path/to/integralstor_unicell.iso /dev/sdN"

Here you need to install 'livecd tools'.

where, /dev/sdN is the USB drive you want to use. This will create a single ext3 partition on the USB stick and copy the necessary files onto that partition, including a complete copy of the integralstor_unicell iso you are using. You can boot a system with a USB stick prepared in this manner and go through the usual install wizard.

- You can also setup your own partitions rather than having the tool do the formatting, Ex., Using a 16 GB USB stick, and do the following prep work:

*Step 1:* Creating necessary partitions.
Code:
     # clear out old partitions
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdN bs=512 count=1
     parted -s /dev/sdN -- mklabel msdos
     # create an 16GB partition, leave room for the mbr
     parted -s /dev/sdN -- mkpart p ext3 512b 16G
     #format partition 1
     mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdN1
where, /dev/sdN is the USB drive you want to use.

*Step 2:* making USB bootable.
Code:
     # using parted tool run the below command for making bootable
     parted /dev/sdN
     # then enter the below input
     toggle 1 boot
     quit

Note: And you can use 'Unetbootin' tool also for this.
